<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Situated at the outskirts of Campinas City (São Paulo State, southeastern Brazil), the Jardim Garcia quarry is composed of mafic intrusive rocks from Serra Geral Formation (Cretaceous, Paraná Basin). It is deactivated and used as a recreational area for activities such as rock climbing and aeromodeling. 
This project focused on create a Digital Outcrop Model of the west side of the quarry, a ∼25 m high and ∼200 m long SSE-NNW rock wall. 
For georeferencing the final 3D model, climbing anchors were surveyed by irradiation from a total station located in an open traverse. The traverse coordinates were obtained by geodetic GNSS post-processing.

Because of the dimensions of the outcrop, we developed a workflow to program autonomous RPA missions designed to acquire images of vertical surfaces with the desired parameters of distance to target and overlap, using the Litchi App. The layout of the flight lines and waypoints resulted in an image overlap greater than nine photos for almost all the wall area.
